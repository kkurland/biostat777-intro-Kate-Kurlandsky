#### The goal of my analysis is to the describe the patient population of the Tuberculosis Epidemiologic Studies Consortium cohort. The intended audience of this project are researchers interested in tuberculosis or cohort studies in general.

This data comes from TBESC-II. "TBESC-II focused on strategies and tools to increase diagnosis and treatment of latent TB infection in populations at high risk of TB infection or progression to TB disease." Other TBESC cycles have different focuses. [Learn More](https://www.cdc.gov/tb/research/tbesc.html)

We can see the way geopolitics trickles down even to the TBESC cohort. Conflicts drive non-refugee and refugee immigration from parts of the world where tuberculosis is much more common.

### Summary

In this analysis, I have briefly described the patient population in the Tuberculosis Epidemiologic Studies Consortium-II. We see that this cohort was enrolled from 2012-2017. The most common country of origin for patients in this cohort is the United States, however the majority of patients were born outside of the United States. This reflects the makeup of tuberculosis cases in the United States broadly. Lastly, we see that the distribution of arrival to the United States among patients in the TBESC differs based on country of origin.
