You also are asked to practice with some command-line skills more formally.\n\n\nPlease use this Quarto file (.qmd) and fill in the requested components by adding the URLs pointing to the GitHub repositories and deployed websites. Render this file to a HTML file.\nYou will push the .qmd file and rendered HTML file to a private GitHub repostory on GitHub classroom. The link to create a private GitHub repository for yourself to complete Project 1 will be posted in CoursePlus (Note: this creates an empty repository. You will need to clone the reopository locally, add your code, and push your code from your local repo to the remote repository on GitHub Classroom when ready). Please show all your code, if relevant to a section.\nThe TAs will grade the contents in the GitHub repo by cloning the repo and checking for all the things described below."

Your website should include the following:\n\nA home/landing page. This is home page that someone will land on your website. At minimum it should include your name, a short summary about yourself (max 2-3 sentences), and a picture of something you enjoy to do for fun (or a picture of yourself if you are comfortable sharing one).\nA page titled ‘About’. This page should describe who you are in greater detail. It could include your professional interests and your educational and/or professional background and/or experience. It could also include any personal information you feel conformable sharing on the website.\nA data analysis page called ‘Example analysis’. You can pick any dataset you wish you analyze. In this webpage, you will analyze a dataset and summarize the results. The requirements for this webpage are the following:\n\nYou must describe what is the question you aim to answer with the data and data analysis.\nYou must describe who is the intended audience for the data analysis.\nYou must describe and link to where the original data come from that you chose.\nYou must include a link to a data dictionary for the data or create one inside the webpage.\nYour analysis must include some minimal form of data wrangling with you using at least five different functions from dplyr or tidyr.\nYour analysis should include at least three plots with you using at least three different geom_*() functions from ggplot2 (or another package with geom_*() functions).\nPlots should have titles, subtitles, captions, and human-understandable axis labels.\nAt least one plot should using a type of faceting (facet_grid() or facet_wrap()).\nYour analysis must include one image or table (not one you created yourself, but one you have saved locally or one from the web).\nYour analysis must include at least two different callout blocks.\nYour analysis must include a .bib file, which you use to reference at least three unique citations. For example, it could be to a website or paper from where the original data came from or it could be to a paper describing a method you are using to analyze the data.\nYour analysis must include the use of at least 1 margin content.\nYou must summarize your analysis and/or results with a paragraph (4-6 sentences).\nAt the end of the data analysis, list out each of the functions you used from each of the packages (dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2) to help the TA with respect to making sure you met all the requirements described above."

The most common country of origin for patients in this cohort is the United States, however the majority of patients were born outside of the United States. This reflects the makeup of tuberculosis cases in the United States broadly. Lastly, we see that the distribution of arrival to the United States among patients in the TBESC differs based on country of origin.\n\n\nFunctions Used\n\ndplyr\n\nread_delim()\nmutate()\nrecode()\ncount()\narrange()\nslice_head()\nfilter()\n\nggplot2\n\ngeom_line()\ngeom_bar()\ngeom_histogram()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nChristine S Ho, Masahiro Narita, Pei-Jean I Feng. 2022. “Comparison of Three Tests for Latent Tuberculosis Infection in High-Risk People in the USA: An Observational Cohort Study.” The Lancet Infectious Diseases 22 (1).\n\n\nDivision of Tuberculosis Elimination; National Center for HIV, STD, Viral Hepatitis, Tuberculosis Prevention; Centers for Disease Control, and Prevention. n.d. https://www.cdc.gov/tb/research/tbesc.html.\n\n\nTracy Ayers, Julia Raykin, Andrew N.
